        <font face="ITALIAN" size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Unit of traumatology and orthopaedic is a fully equipped unit recognized by Pakistan Medical
 and Dental council and by college of physicians and surgeons. This shows that we have an experienced and professional team to look
 after our patients. There are regular compulsory courses and workshops for team doctors in liason with other hospitals to keep their
knowledge and skill updated concerning patients care and management.

This unit has separate male and female orthopaedic wards with eleven beds each. Along with these wards, we also have a number of
 private rooms. Orthopaedic unit has very busy out patient department where over five hundred patients are seen and treated every month
. Operation theaters are equally busy where more than two hundred patients are operated every month. The operation theater is fully
 equipped with two image intensifiers, fracture table, arthroscopy instrumentation along with different types of locking nail equipment.

Ittefaq hospital is the pioneer in arthroscopic surgery in Lahore where knee and shoulder arthroscopies were started. At present,
 we are doing 50-60 arthroscopies of the major joints per year.

Orthopaedic unit at Ittefaq hospital deals with a massive influx of accidents and caters for a large catchment area. 
There is a 24 hours on call trauma team which includes a consultant, a registrar, a medical officer along with a 24 hours 
ready theater and theater on call team to deal with any kind of emergency or trauma that lands up at Ittefaq hospital. Infact we are now
 a referral center for maltreated or infected long bone fractures. We are in the process of starting new methods of retrograde closed
 interlocking nail humerus, not yet being done in Pakistan. All other kinds of fractures i.e. hip fractures, long bones fractures and
 spine fracture etc are dealt with in this unit.</p>

<p> There are many industrial hand injuries, which are taken care of by the trauma unit.

We have a large number of elective operations done at our unit, which include total hip replacements, total knee replacements. These 
operations are being done on a regular basis. Disc and other back operations along with congenital deformities of infants and children
 done here for lengthening bones which are shortened due to disease, fractures or congenital problems.

There is a close liason between Orthopaedic unit at Ittefaq and plastic surgeons because many accidents have open wounds that need looking
 after of their skin and soft tissues.

We have a very efficient computerized data storing system along with strict regular follow up of all patients who go through our department.
 We have a regular morbidity and mortality check of the department. Our complication rate is comparable to any trauma and orthopaedic unit
 in Europe and America. </font></p>
